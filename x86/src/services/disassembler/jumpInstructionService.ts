Workaround for Bug in ndisasm:
When ndisasm reads a jump/call instruction which is not within its program context it returns the wrong address operand.
When the entire program is read the address seems to be correct, which is why this is not an issue during normal use.
Since we read the instructions one by one, it always returns the wrong address.

For example:
BC,40,00,00,00,  // mov esp, 0x40
E8,71,00,00,00   // call 0x7b

ndisasm outputs the correct code if you enter the entire machine code.
But if you enter only "E8,71,00,00,00", the result is wrong:
call 0x76; instead of 7b

Solution:
When the opcode shows a Jump or Call instruction, we show the assembly translation of Capstone instead of ndisasm

export default function isJmpCallInstructionWORKAROUND(opcode: Uint8Array): boolean {
  let index: number;
  const firstByteOfTwoByteOpcodes = 0x0F;
  if (opcode[0] === firstByteOfTwoByteOpcodes) {
    index = opcodesTwoByteJmpInstructions.findIndex((jmpCode) => jmpCode === opcode[1]);
  } else {
    index = opcodesJmpCallInstructions.findIndex((jmpCode) => jmpCode === opcode[0]);
  }
  return index >= 0;
}
